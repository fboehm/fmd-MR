title: "Exploring the creatinine GWAS summary statistics & FMD GWAS meta-analysis summary statistics"
format: gfm

We want to "explore" the two results files to see how many SNPs are available in each, and to see 
how many SNPs are in both files. This information will inform 2-sample MR studies to 
assess the causal effect of FMD on creatinine levels.

First, we read into R the creatinine summary statistics file.

```{r}
cre_file <- here::here("")
cre_tib <- vroom::vroom(cre_file)
```
