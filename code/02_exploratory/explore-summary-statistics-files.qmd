title: "Exploring the creatinine GWAS summary statistics & FMD GWAS meta-analysis summary statistics"
format: gfm
---

We want to "explore" the two results files to see how many SNPs are available in each, and to see 
how many SNPs are in both files. This information will inform 2-sample MR studies to 
assess the causal effect of FMD on creatinine levels.

First, we read into R the creatinine summary statistics file.

```{r}
cre_file <- here::here("ukb_gwas", "biomarkers-30700-both_sexes-irnt.tsv.bgz")
cre_tib <- vroom::vroom(cre_file)
```

```{r}
fmd_file <- here::here("fmd_meta_gwas", 
                        "meta_analyse_FMD_FUMA_FR_MAYO_DEFINE_POL_MGI_FEIRI_HRC_all_2020-08-12.tab")
fmd_tib <- vroom::vroom(fmd_file)
```
